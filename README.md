# TCP_Analysis
The objective of this project is as follows:
  1. Understand how to change pcap file context
  2. Analyze the captured packets
  3. Test automation using a large pcap file
  4. Perform traffic flow analysis based on information obtained.
  
Sample code was provided. But implementing key functions is necessary to complete the task.
The code is written in C. The goal is to open up the Ethernet, IP and TCP packets and gather necessary packet details.
